# Testing Mathematical Notation

Just the Docs supports rendering math using LaTeX syntax. You can write math inline with your text or as separate display blocks.

## Inline Math

Inline math is placed between single dollar signs (`$$ ... $$`).

Here's a simple equation: $$x + 2 = 5$$.
We can use exponents: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$.
Or fractions: $$\frac{1}{2}$$.
Greek letters are common: $$\alpha + \beta = \gamma$$.
You can also use subscripts: $$H_2O$$.

This allows you to include small mathematical expressions directly within your sentences, like solving for $x$ in the equation $3x - 7 = 11$.

## Display Math

Display math is typically placed between double dollar signs (`$$ ... $$`). This renders the equation on its own line, often centered and slightly larger.

A basic display equation:
$$ E = mc^2 $$

A more complex example with a fraction and square root:
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

An integral:
$$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx $$

A summation:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$

Display math is great for showcasing important formulas or derivations clearly, separated from the surrounding text.
